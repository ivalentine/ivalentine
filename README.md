## Hi there :wave:

I'm looking for work! :eyes:

Here's why you should hire me:

### Skilled practitioner, eager learner

I am an AWS Certified Developer â€“ Associate. Currently, I work with Node.js, TypeScript, Ruby on Rails, AWS (API Gateway, CloudFormation, Lambda, VPC, VPN), and Serverless Framework.

I'm currently learning [Lamby](https://github.com/customink/lamby), and some technologies I'm interested in learning are Java, Kubernetes, and Terraform. I'd also like to obtain the AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional certification.

Outside of work, I enjoy learning other languages. Over the years, I've formally studied French, Spanish, and Japanese, and I'm currently learning Polish and a bit of German. I delight in discovering similarities and patterns across languages!

### Enthusiastic collaborator

I believe that sharing what you've learned (and what you're trying to learn) is just as important as learning itself.

When I first learned Ruby on Rails, I asked a question about strong params on Stack Overflow that now has [10,000 views](https://stackoverflow.com/q/31413926/3020195). In my six years of working as a software engineering coach at Flatiron School, I expanded upon my role of directly helping individual students by creating help articles addressing common issues. Some of these articles still exist in some form today, like [this one](https://flatironschoolsupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500005840001-Error-timeout-of-2000ms-exceeded) about Mocha timeouts.

### Interested?

Let me know! My email is ian@ivalentine.net.
